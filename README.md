  - I once tried to learn how to juggle while coding at the same time! It didn’t go too well… 😅<br>
  - I have an obsession with clean code (but I promise, my jokes are not bug-free either!).<br>
  - My favorite way to relax is by playing coding challenges (yes, I’m that geeky!).<br>
  - I enjoy experimenting with CSS animations – it’s like creating magic with code! ✨<br>
  - Fun fact: I can code with a coffee in hand and still deliver clean code... most of the time! ☕💻
